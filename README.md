Welcome back to our Informatica Cinema! In the first part, you created the skeleton of the application where the basic layout is laid out. In this second part, you'll make it pretty by adding styling and some images. Again, the result will look something like this:

**Template:**
No need to use any other template, this repo is more than enough! üòÅ

**Objectives:**
1. Clone the template repo to get started. The original layout has already been added for you, so you don't have to copy and paste it from part 01.

2. Try to get your screen to match the original styling as much as possible. Modify the _HomeScreen.java_ file and add your code ( mainly styling ) to it. Modify the _homescreen.css_ file and add your css code to it.

3. Use the colours provided in the _homescreen.css_ file as reference, use the _icons_ located in the images folder and finally use the _Montserrat_ fonts located in the fonts folder.

4. Code quality with regard to reliability, readability, adaptability, maintainability, safety and / or performance should be high.

5. Commit and push your solution to the GitHub repo, and let us know via the hand-in button beneath.
